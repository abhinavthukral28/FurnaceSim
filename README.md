Welcome to Furnace Simulator!

This is an internet of things project which connects a thermostat to a furnace. 

Start the system by using node to start thermostat.js and furnace.js

You can then visit the app on localhost:3000.

The page will provide the following information;

-Temperature in Ottawa,ON (Outside temperature)
-The temperature of the building (Current temperature)
-The set temperature of the thermostat 

The page will also let you modify the set temperature if you are the first or only one connected to the application.
